- Grade: 73/100 --- Award: First Class Honours/Pass with Distinction. 
- Topic description: This project investigates the application of gesture recognition in the context of a surgical operating room where touchless interface is paramount to maintaining sterility. This project proposes a new method of building such systems, using Googleâ€™s newly released MediaPipe framework to do so. A model has been built and tested with promising results.
